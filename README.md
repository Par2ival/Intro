# world.... Hello

I know little about alot, and looking to learn alot more.

Proficient but inefficient in Phython, looking to improve on mu Bash and learn to code C (apparently is similar to Arduino...Yay).

Like to tinker and build things.

Love Lunix but dont use it much because "The Man" has me by the short and curlies.
